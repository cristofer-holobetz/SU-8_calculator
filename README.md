# SU-8_calculator
This is an open source calculator for quickly producing ramp rate, bake times, bake temperatures, exposure energies 
and development times for the photoresist series SU-8. All data used in these calculations is the property of
MicroChem and is publicly available on the internet in the form of data sheets.

Functionality for an increasing number of photoresists will be added as I go through the tedious process of transcribing
data into csv files.

So far, the list of supported photoresists is: 

SU-8_[2000.5, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2015, 2025, 2035, 2050, 2075, 2100, 2150]
